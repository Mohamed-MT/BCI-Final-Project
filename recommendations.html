          <h2>Future Recommendations</h2>

          <p>To reduce the harmful impacts of BCIs, several steps can be taken. Technologically, improvements are needed in implant durability, surgical safety, and long-term signal reliability. Stronger safeguards for neural data should be implemented to protect users’ privacy and prevent unauthorized access.</p>

          <p>Socially, there should be clear education for users and the public about what BCIs can realistically provide. Individuals adapting to implanted devices may require ongoing psychological support. Ensuring fair access is also important so that advances in BCI technology do not widen existing inequalities.</p>

          <p>On a policy level, governments should treat neural data as highly sensitive information and create strict legal protections around its use. Regulations should require long-term safety monitoring for implanted devices and promote transparency when companies report side effects, errors, or device failures.</p>

          <p>Together, these steps can help make BCIs safer, more ethical, and more beneficial to society as the technology continues to advance.</p>
