# BCI Final Project Website
This repository contains the final project website for our IT 304 course. The project examines **Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs)** and analyzes how this technology is used in real-world settings, along with the social and ethical challenges that come with it.

## Overview
The website presents a focused analysis of Brain–Computer Interfaces, a technology that enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices. The goal of the project is to explain what BCIs are, how they are currently being used, and what issues arise when the technology is applied in society.

## Website Content
The website includes four main sections:

### 1. Introduction  
Provides a clear explanation of what BCIs are, how they function, and why the technology is significant.

### 2. Applications  
Describes real-world use cases of BCIs, particularly in medical and commercial contexts. This section also discusses the challenges and limitations of using BCIs, supported by references.

### 3. Critical Discussion  
Analyzes the social, political, and ethical implications of BCIs. This section applies two ethical lenses — Utilitarianism and Deontology to evaluate the impacts and concerns surrounding the technology.

### 4. Recommendations  
Offers practical technical, social, and policy recommendations to reduce risks and support responsible development and use of BCI technology.
