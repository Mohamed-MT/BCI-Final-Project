          <h2>Critical Discussion of BCIs</h2>

          <p>BCIs have significant social implications because they change how humans interact with technology and potentially with each other. On the positive side, BCIs can increase independence and communication abilities for people with disabilities. However, they also raise political and social concerns, particularly regarding who controls neural data and how it might be used.</p>

          <p>There are concerns about surveillance, manipulation, or commercial exploitation of neural information. In terms of risks, invasive BCIs involve surgical hazards, potential device failures, emotional stress for users, and the possibility of unintended actions caused by misinterpreted neural signals. These risks raise important questions about accountability, especially when a brain-controlled device produces an unintended output.</p>

          <p>From a utilitarian perspective, BCIs are ethical when the benefits—such as restored communication, mobility, or independence—outweigh potential harms. This lens focuses on overall quality of life and the number of people who may benefit.</p>

          <p>From a deontological perspective, the focus shifts to individual rights and moral duties. This approach emphasizes informed consent, autonomy, and strict protection of neural data. Even if BCIs help many people, violations of privacy or pressure to undergo implantation would be considered unethical.</p>

          <p>These two ethical perspectives show that BCIs can be viewed either as powerful tools to improve well-being or as technologies that require strong boundaries to protect individual rights.</p>
